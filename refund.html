        Refund Policy for webflow Pty Ltd
        <br><br>
        At Webflow, we are dedicated to providing exceptional web design services tailored to meet our clients' unique needs and expectations. We take pride in our commitment to delivering high-quality websites that align with the original design specifications. Our refund policy is designed to ensure fairness and clarity for both our valued clients and our team of skilled professionals.
        <br><br>
        1. Refunds for Non-Compliance with Original Design: 
        We understand the importance of adhering to the agreed-upon design concepts. If, for any reason, the final website fails to meet the specifications outlined in the original design brief, we are more than willing to discuss the issue and provide a suitable solution. In such cases, a refund may be processed after a thorough evaluation of the non-compliance.
        <br><br>
        2. Refunds for Changes of Mind:
        Once the website development process has commenced, refunds will not be issued due to a change of mind by the client. It is essential to provide clear and detailed instructions during the initial stages of the project to ensure your vision is accurately captured in the design. We encourage open communication to address any concerns before the project enters the development phase. But we do consider edits in the final project either free of charge or with an editing fee up to 20% of the original price.
        <br><br>
        3. No Refunds after Website Publication:
        Once the website has been published and made live, refunds cannot be provided under any circumstances. We highly recommend reviewing the website thoroughly and conducting necessary testing before approving its publication. Post-publication, any further changes or modifications can be accommodated through our standard revision process, subject to applicable fees.
        <br><br>
        How to Request a Refund: 
        To request a refund based on non-compliance with the original design, clients are required to submit a detailed report outlining the specific aspects where the design has deviated from the agreed-upon specifications. Our team will review the report and work towards a resolution within a reasonable timeframe. Contact Us: For refund requests or any concerns related to our services, please contact our customer support team at support@webflowau.com or 0401 431 306. We value your business and are here to assist you in every way possible. Thank you for choosing Webflow for your web design needs. We appreciate the opportunity to work with you and are committed to delivering outstanding results that exceed your expectations.
